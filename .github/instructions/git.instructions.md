# Git & PR Instructions

## Branch Naming
- All lowercase, `snake_case` (words separated by `_`)
- 2-4 words describing the change — not a ticket number, not a filename
- End with `_<github_username>` — the author's lowercase GitHub username (get it via
  `gh api user --jq .login`; `gh` is already a required tool in this repo, see
  `index.instructions.md`)
- Example: `add_branch_naming_rules_lbecker`

## Pull Request Description
- Title: concise summary, under 70 characters
- Body:
  - `## Summary` — 1-3 sentences describing the overall change
  - `## Changes` — a bulleted list of the key changes (one bullet per logical change, not per file)

This is the canonical PR format for this repo — `.github/prompts/pr.prompt.md` and
`pr-notes.prompt.md` (and their `.claude/commands/`/`.clinerules/workflows/` mirrors) implement it;
see `prompts.instructions.md` for how those commands are kept in sync.
