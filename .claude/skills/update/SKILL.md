# Update Workflow

Use this file as source of truth: `.github/prompts/update.prompt.md`

When the user asks for version checks, read that prompt file and follow it — this only updates
locks, it never installs anything or runs an upgrade.

```bash
uv run --no-sync invoke ver.all
```

Run `/update`-equivalent checks before any `/upgrade` unless the user explicitly asks to upgrade
directly (mirrors `apt update && apt upgrade`) — see the `upgrade` skill.
