# Test Workflow

Use this file as source of truth: `.github/prompts/test.prompt.md`

When the user asks to run tests/linters, or an equivalent `/test` request, read that prompt file
and follow it.

```bash
uv run --no-sync invoke fix
uv run --no-sync invoke test
```

The required result is a 10.00/10 Pylint score with exit code 0 before committing.
