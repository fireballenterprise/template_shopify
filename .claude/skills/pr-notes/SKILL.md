# PR Notes Workflow

Use this file as source of truth: `.github/prompts/pr-notes.prompt.md`

When the user asks to draft PR notes or a PR description, read that prompt file and follow it.

```bash
uv run --no-sync invoke repo.pr_diff
```

Write the description using the canonical `## Summary` / `## Changes` format from
`.github/instructions/git.instructions.md`, then save it:

```bash
uv run --no-sync invoke repo.pr_notes_save --content="<the notes>"
```

If you're running as a step inside another command (e.g. `pr` or `ship-it`), don't save —
just hold the composed notes for that command to use directly.
