# upgrade - Upgrade Python and/or Dependencies

Executes upgrades to Python and/or package dependencies after you've reviewed changes via `/update`.

## Usage

Upgrade everything (interactive):
Run this terminal command:

```
uv run --no-sync invoke upgrade
```

Upgrade only Python:
Run this terminal command:

```
uv run --no-sync invoke upgrade.python
```

Upgrade only libs:
Run this terminal command:

```
uv run --no-sync invoke upgrade.libs
```

Sync dependencies without checking for updates:
Run this terminal command:

```
uv run --no-sync invoke upgrade.sync
```

## Description

The upgrade command performs actual installations and syncs:
- Downloads and installs new Python versions (if updated)
- Rebuilds virtual environment (if Python changed)
- Runs `uv sync --upgrade` to install updated dependencies

## Workflow

Best practice:
1. Run `/update` to review and update config files
2. Check `git diff` to see what changed
3. If satisfied, run `/upgrade` to execute the upgrades
4. If not satisfied, run `git restore` and adjust

## Examples

```bash
# Full workflow
/update                    # Review and update all configs
git diff                    # Review changes
/upgrade                    # Execute upgrades

# Python-only workflow
/update python             # Review and update Python configs
git diff                    # Review changes
/upgrade python             # Execute Python upgrade

# Libs-only workflow
/update libs               # Review and update lib versions in pyproject.toml
git diff                    # Review changes
/upgrade libs               # Execute libs upgrade
```

## Exit Codes

- 0: Success (upgrades completed or nothing needed)
- 1: Error occurred
- 2: Cancelled by user
